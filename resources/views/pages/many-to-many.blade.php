                <p>
                    Many to many relationships use an reference, or pivot table as part of the 'normalisation'
                    process to remove redundancy and issues with data integrity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here are some possible situations using one to many relationships:

                <p class="text-xs text-neutral-100 bg-neutral-700 p-2 rounded leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>Note:</strong>
                    In many relationships there may be situations where one side may have zero or more items related
                    to it. This is quite common. Likewise you may require there to be at least one related item
                    between the two entities (tables/models).
